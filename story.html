                        <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
                        <br>
                        <h3>ARRIVAL</h3>
                        <p>There were some lights. And some noise. Strange noise. Annoying, like scratching on school board… just quieter. And Iona couldn’t see clearly. Everything was dizzy in his head. He tried to raise head, move arm, or leg… Anything
                            – but unsuccessfully. Completely exhausted, he closed his eyes again. It was cold, wet and smelly. It looked like… some building… unknown kind. But it smelled bed. And there was no proper floor, just dirt and mud. With last
                            atoms of his strength, Iona managed to look around himself. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It was wooden building, small and old. Roof was leaking – obviously it was raining outside. Strange thing – Iona couldn’t hear nothing. Straight from him was door. Wooden, and mostly broken, it was miracle that they hold together.
                            Cold wind was passing through. Although freezing, fresh air was still very much welcomed by Iona – smell inside was unbearable. In one corner, Iona noticed some weapon. It looked like some primitive kind of gun – magazine p
                            was above short rifle barrel, stock was just one bended piece of metal. It looked like shit, and probably was as precise.

        <div class="container">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p align="justify">Iona didn’t have any idea where he is. Nor how he got there. He tried to think, but his head was heavy. Last thing he remember was… Actually nothing – he did not remember nothing. He just knew his name is Iona and nothing else. How
                        old was he? Did he have family? Where he came from? And how he came here? Was he hurt? What is this place? Too many questions for one tired head. His arms and legs didn’t listen to him. Maybe he was dying_ Does death look like
                        this? They always said, in books and movies, that in moment of your death whole your life pass in front of your eyes. He wasn’t even sure in his name. </p> <br>
                    <p>It is called amnesia. That state when you forget everything. And it can be tricky – some people never remember their life. But he knows what amnesia is – so, that should mean he have some memory – long-term, or something like that.
                        If he knows what amnesia is, he should remember something from school time… But Iona couldn’t remember anything. Did he go to school at all? Minute by minute, Iona panicked more and more. He was so exhausted, so confused, so helpless.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>His hearing was getting better, though. Or so it seemed. He heard loud noises from outside. It got him thinking, his brain finally activating… Spectra rifle… Full discharge, rifle overheated and burned it’s left hand – it was probably
                        defective. But he cannot remember when that happened. Not even his face… Just that small detail of rifle bursting in his hands. Strange how human brain works…</p> <br>
                    <p> However, noises outside were not like rifle he used to know. They were louder, more primitive… Probably that gun in the corner sounded like that. Iona didn’t have what to lose. He will die anyway, lying immobile in pool of mud. He
                        started screaming as loud as he could. Yelling for help, or for bullet in his head – just to stop this torture. Nobody answered. Gunshots were sporadic, probably too far away to hear him. He laid back his head one more. What was
                        he in his real life? </p>
